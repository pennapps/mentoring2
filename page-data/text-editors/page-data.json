They are document software, and that is a BIG DIFFERENCE), feel free to use that. If you’re a beginner, we recommend using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). To do so, please click on the “Download” bar at the top and download either Sublime Text 3 or the newest version of Sublime Text 2.\n\nOnce you have it downloaded, you can use it to create plain-text files for whatever kind of language you are using. Name your file with the correct extension (.html for HTML, .js for JavaScript, .hs for Haskell, etc.) and Sublime will automatically recognize it and highlight it appropriately. Click [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/index.htm) for a comprehensive tutorial of Sublime Text for beginners, or [here](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/beginners-guide-for-sublime-text/) for a more succinct guide.\n\nYou should also install the Sublime Package Manager, which lets you extend the functionality of Sublime Text with pre-written packages. To install the package manager, follow the instructions on this [site](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) according to your version of Sublime (Sublime Text 2 or Sublime Text 3).\n\nAfter that, check out this [page](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage) for straightforward explanations of how to use the package manager. You can also utilize this [search bar](https://packagecontrol.io/search) to find additional cool packages to install (you can also search from Sublime itself).\n\nFor a few more advanced Sublime Text tips and shortcuts to enhance your productivity, click [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/06/shortcuts-and-tips-for-improving-your-productivity-with-sublime-text/), or if you’re looking specifically for Sublime Text 3’s, visit this [page](https://generalassemb.ly/blog/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/).\n\nYou can also check out a few more [advanced Sublime tips](http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/inspiration/10-must-know-sublime-text-2-tips/).\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Beginner’s guide](https://www.loginradius.com/blog/async/beginners-guide-for-sublime-text/)\n- [Comprehensive tutorial of sublime text for beginners](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sublime_text/index.htm)\n- [Packages guide](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage)\n- [Installing packages](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)\n- [Advanced tips/shortcuts](https://generalassemb.ly/blog/sublime-text-3-tips-tricks-shortcuts/)\n- [Search bar](https://packagecontrol.io/search)\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
