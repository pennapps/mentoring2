Similar to Java, it is primarily an object-oriented language (see the [Java / OOP page](http://mentoring.pennapps.com/guide/BeginnerJava.html) for more information on that). However, compared to Java, Python is designed to be extremely readable and usually requires fewer lines of code. To see this simplicity, here is a “Hello World!” program in Python:\n\n`print “Hello World!”`\n\nFurthermore, Python has a “batteries included” philosophy, meaning that many important and useful libraries are already included. This makes Python a very good place to start for new programmers.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Python Beginner’s Guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)\n- [Python Guide for Non-Programmers!](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)\n- [Beginner Python Tutorial](http://www.sthurlow.com/python/)\n- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)\n"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
