# Python

## A simple and powerful coding language

Python is a widely used programming language. Similar to Java, it is primarily and object-oriented language (see the [Java / OOP page](http://mentoring.pennapps.com/guide/BeginnerJava.html) for more information on that). However, compared to Java, Python is designed to be extremely readable and usually requires fewer lines of code. To see this simplicity, here is a “Hello World!” program in Python:

`print “Hello World!”`

Furthermore, Python has a “batteries included” philosophy, meaning that many important and useful libraries are already included. This makes Python a very good place to start for new programmers.
